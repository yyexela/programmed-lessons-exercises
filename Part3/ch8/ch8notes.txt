1) error when using large # for short: 
.\Shortfall.java:3: error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from int to short

^ when using int, it works

2)
short = 16 bits
double = 64 bits

max value = 1.7976931348623157E308

3)
e^(3200+) = infinity; according to java

4)
what works for char: 
'A'
'Z'
' '
what doesn't work:
'AA'
''
"A"

Double quotes = string, not a char
