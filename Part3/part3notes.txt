1 byte is 8 bits
Short stores 16 bits/ 2 bytes (max value is (2^16-1)/2 since it goes from - to +)
Int stores 32 bits/ 4 bytes (max values is +(2^32-2)/2, -(2^32)/2)
double stores 64 bits/ 8 bytes 
Largest value of a number = NUM.MAX_VALUE

Primitive data types (case sensitive): 
byte (8 bits) (1 byte)
short (16 bits) (2 bytes)
int (32 bits) (4 bytes)
long (64 bits) (8 bytes)
float (32 bits) (4 bytes) (floating point)
double (64 bits) (8 bytes) (floating point)
char (16 bits) (2 bytes)
boolean

int and double have different bit patterns: floating point and integer

String and Scanner are classes

A primitive data type is: a method for representing values that is a fundamental part of a language

a-Z can be used for variables, 0-9, $, and _   ONLY. NOT - or ` or \] etc
cannot start with digit
cannot be a reserved word (ex int or double)

Declaration: int tree;
Assignment: tree = 3;
assignment changes old value to new one, initilization give it its first value

expression: combination of literals, operators, variables, and parenthesis
operator: arithmetic symbol like * + - /
operand: a value acted upon by an operator (number)


when a variable is not initialized, an error occurs when the variable name is used

when doing math, the value is always stored as 32 bits unless one or more values are 64 bits

an object is created at runtime and is different than its reference variable

a class is a description of a kind of object
an object is a chunk of memory that can contain data along with methods to process data
no objects exist when a program starts running, they are created one by one
a reference to an object is data on where the object is located

Exception: object that has information about what went wrong
When an exception is sent to a higher level of the system, it throws the exception

numeric data is first character data then is converted into a primitive numeric type

keyboard input data is always character data

most math functions expect doubles as arguments

CODE:
exp(2) = e^2
final double pi = 3.141; (final means the variable won't change, it is a constant)
x.length(); counts characters used in string
x.trim(); trims off spaces and tabs from end of string
java.util.Scanner;
scan.nextLine();
scan.nextInt();
scan.nextDouble();
java.text.*;
DecimalFormat numform = new DecimalFormat("0.0");
NUM.MAX_VALUE;
