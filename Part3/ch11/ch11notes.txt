"an object and its reference variable are different things, and that an object is created at run time"
the '.substring(x, y)' code shortens a string by starting from x (assuming the first character is 0) to y-1

index notes:
same value = no string is printed
end value is longer than string = java error
beginning is less than 0 = java error
beginning is larger than ending = java error
